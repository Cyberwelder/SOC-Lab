# SOC Lab

## Objective


This SOC Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned


- General understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- General understanding in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- General ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- General knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used


- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- System monitoring tools (such as Sysmon) for capturing detailed logs and dectecing malicious activity.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
